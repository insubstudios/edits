Getting Started
===

[Welcome](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/)
---

"comprehensive guide"

"Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator."

---

[Quick-start guide](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/quickstart/)
---

	# Install Jekyll and Bundler gems through RubyGems
	~ $ gem install jekyll bundler
	
	# Create a new Jekyll site at ./myblog
	~ $ jekyll new myblog
	
	# Change into your new directory
	~ $ cd myblog
	
	# Build the site on the preview server
	~/myblog $ bundle exec jekyll serve
	
	# Now browse to http://localhost:4000

[bundler](https://rubygems.org/gems/bundler) is a ruby gem that manages other gems. #dependencies not required, i.e. can run `jekyll serve` without `bundle exec`.

### new site options:

 - `--force` to create a site in non-empty dir
 - `--skip-bundle` to not init sire w/ bundler
 - `--blank` to not use a [gem-based theme](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/), default [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima)
 - `jekyll new --help`, also works with `build` and `serve`

### next steps:

blog posts, front matter, control templates and layouts, and more :-)


---

[Installation](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)
---

### requirements

 - gnu/linux, unix, or mac os
 - ruby 2.0+
 - rubygems
 - gss and make

[extras](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/extras/) ...ooo, customize markdown processing. [maaath](http://gastonsanchez.com/visually-enforced/opinion/2014/02/16/Mathjax-with-jekyll/).

---

[Basic Usage](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/usage/)
---

`build` and `build -w`. you can do something with `--destination <dest>` and `--source <src>`, but it doesn't say what that's for.
